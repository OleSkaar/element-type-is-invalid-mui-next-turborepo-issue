# Reproduction of "Element type is invalid" issue with Next.js and Turborepo

This repo is created to reproduce an error seen in a project with Material UI, Next.js, and Turborepo.

The setup is adapted from a previous issue with the same error: https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/40214, https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/, and https://mui.com/material-ui/integrations/nextjs/
